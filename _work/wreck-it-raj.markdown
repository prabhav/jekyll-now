- title: Synopsis
  content: "A vacant window pane provides a view of a suburban household with luscious
    green landscape. \nCrunching of gravel under approaching footsteps. The bare frame
    fills up with the outline of RAJDEEP, 11, a sikh kid in bright clothes and a green
    turban. He cradles a cricket bat on his shoulders as he keenly\nobserves the glass
    in front of him. After some careful\nconsideration and calculation, he takes his
    bat off his shoulder and then takes a step back.\n\nBANG!"

- title: Concept
  content: "In 2015, a sikh boy recorded himself facing racist bullies and went viral.\nIt
    reinstated how tough it is for kids who grow up with a cultural distinction. \L\LThis
    film attempts to imagine an aftermath of the situation and puts a spin on it."
