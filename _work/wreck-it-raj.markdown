  content: "In 2015, a sikh boy recorded himself facing racist bullies and went viral.\nIt
    reinstated how tough it is for kids who grow up with a cultural distinction. \L\LThis
    film attempts to imagine an aftermath of the situation and puts a spin on it."

- title: Director's Statement
  content: God on a leash is a short documentary that was shot in my hometown of New
    Delhi. I was acquainted to this cultural practice at a very young age and through
    this documentary, I am finally able to unravel the intricacies of this culture.
    We followed a Madari, who sat with his macaques and their o spring near a Hanuman
    temple at North Campus. It seemed the baby’s future in chains was indomitable,
    much like the o springs of the ancestral impressionists community. It created
    a cruel euphemism about our ignorance, the way we choose to live our lives, follow
    our traditions and practice our faith. The film is a window to a highly embellished
    niche world with a contrastingly unembellished human experience.
