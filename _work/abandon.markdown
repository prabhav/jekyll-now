  content: Two ancestral artforms survive through the veneration of Hanuman, a hindu
    deity with a monkey face and human body. This is the story of being held on a
    leash to the hands of faith, heritage and poverty that explores the concept of
    humanism and divinity.

- title: Synopsis
  content: |
    A defeatist, suicidal teen AUSTIN feels captured in broad californian daylight in his foster care room at a group home facility for emotionally troubled youth. He is secluded and alone in his first foster home experience that houses dizzying array of troubled teens including his intimidating roommate Matias, a juvenile convict.

    With a sharp Shard of a window glass in his right hand;  Austin attempts to splice his left wrist before he is pinned down by an employee. In the time of dire need of support, Austin meets a wisp of a girl, FAITH. 9 year old going on 18.

    Together, they sneak out to go AWOL from the restraints of the group home. But, the world outside is cruel and they are underprepared. What emerges is a powerful study of the sensibility of at-risk kids confined in a broken system , ostracised by the society.

- title: Concept
  content: The film will draw parallels between the life of a captured monkey family,
    20 year old Dharmendra, his 15 year old mate Hema and their offspring Isha. They
    all travel from place to place with their human master Daleep. These animals dress
    up and perform actions like humans for public amusement. Amidst all the frolic
    lies the true reality of how they are being mistreated and trained. Their teeth
    are taken out, they are starved out and are kept in an pathetic state in a flies
    and mosquito infested area, tied to a rusted iron leash. On the other hand, we
    follow a child from the Behrupiya (impressionist) community who dresses up like
    a monkey and mimics the animal for public entertainment. The impressionist community
    is in a dire state of being, safeguarding a thousand year old artform. The community
    suffers with the lack of education and the coming generation is forced to be in
    the state of poverty due to lack of an alternate skill. Without a proper rehabilitation,
    they would continue to be in the chains of poverty.

- title: Director's Statement
  content: "Abandon is a sensitive dramatic piece about lives of children with scarred
    childhood and how they find routes to survive. My association to the cause of
    childcare can be traced back to volunteering with non profit organizations that
    relocate abandoned children from Train junctions to group homes. These efforts
    to save them from delinquency, substance abuse or sex trade often proved futile
    because of a questionable efficacy of group homes.\n \nThis film is an effort
    to harness my artistic potential to make a change, to give voice to the mute.
    In order to be honest in portrayal, me and my team have consulted and collaborated
    with multiple non profits, children and social workers who have worked in foster
    care facilities.\n"
