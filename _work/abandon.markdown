- title: Synopsis
  content: |
    Secluded in a group home for troubled teens, Austin attempts to splice his left wrist before he is pinned down by an employee. In the time of dire support, Austin meets a wisp of a girl - Faith.

    Together, they sneak out to go AWOL from the restraints of the group home. But, the world outside is cruel and much different from what they imagined. What emerges is a powerful study of the sensibility of at-risk kids confined in a broken system, ostracized by the society.

- title: Background
  content: "On a June morning of 2013, a calm neighborhood in Davis, California woke
    up to the sirens of police cars searching and detaining escaped children from
    a local park. Kids as young as 9 had gone awol from a group home facility.\n\nDavis
    descends into chaos when it was discovered that the children left the campus for
    days at a time, often in large groups. Sexual assault allegations were unearthed.
    Two boys were arrested that day for raping an 11-year-old girl. \n\nFrom the group
    home, the calls for help came day and night from the group home for troubled children
    in Davis, California. Dozens a day – to the police, to state authorities, the
    unending pleas chronicling sexual assaults and suicide tries, runaways and random
    violence. Children were conveniently  vilified in the public eye but there was
    no denying that a rescue was mounted too late, and the disaster in Davis to this
    day haunts those it touched.\n\nGroup homes have increasingly been deemed a failed
    model, yet year after year vulnerable and volatile children remain housed in them
    for lack of a better option."

- title: Director's Statement
  content: "Abandon is a sensitive dramatic piece about lives of children with scarred
    childhood and how they find routes to survive. My association to the cause of
    childcare can be traced back to volunteering with non profit organizations that
    relocate abandoned children from Train junctions to group homes. These efforts
    to save them from delinquency, substance abuse or sex trade often proved futile
    because of a questionable efficacy of group homes.\n \nThis film is an effort
    to harness my artistic potential to make a change, to give voice to the mute.
    In order to be honest in portrayal, me and my team have consulted and collaborated
    with multiple non profits, children and social workers who have worked in foster
    care facilities.\n"
