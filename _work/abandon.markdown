- title: Synopsis
  content: |
    Secluded in a group home for troubled teens, Austin attempts to splice his left wrist before he is pinned down by an employee. In the time of dire support, Austin meets a wisp of a girl - Faith.

    Together, they sneak out to go AWOL from the restraints of the group home. But, the world outside is cruel and they are underprepared. What emerges is a powerful study of the sensibility of at-risk kids confined in a broken system , ostracized by the society.

- title: Concept
  content: The film will draw parallels between the life of a captured monkey family,
    20 year old Dharmendra, his 15 year old mate Hema and their offspring Isha. They
    all travel from place to place with their human master Daleep. These animals dress
    up and perform actions like humans for public amusement. Amidst all the frolic
    lies the true reality of how they are being mistreated and trained. Their teeth
    are taken out, they are starved out and are kept in an pathetic state in a flies
    and mosquito infested area, tied to a rusted iron leash. On the other hand, we
    follow a child from the Behrupiya (impressionist) community who dresses up like
    a monkey and mimics the animal for public entertainment. The impressionist community
    is in a dire state of being, safeguarding a thousand year old artform. The community
    suffers with the lack of education and the coming generation is forced to be in
    the state of poverty due to lack of an alternate skill. Without a proper rehabilitation,
    they would continue to be in the chains of poverty.

- title: Director's Statement
  content: "Abandon is a sensitive dramatic piece about lives of children with scarred
    childhood and how they find routes to survive. My association to the cause of
    childcare can be traced back to volunteering with non profit organizations that
    relocate abandoned children from Train junctions to group homes. These efforts
    to save them from delinquency, substance abuse or sex trade often proved futile
    because of a questionable efficacy of group homes.\n \nThis film is an effort
    to harness my artistic potential to make a change, to give voice to the mute.
    In order to be honest in portrayal, me and my team have consulted and collaborated
    with multiple non profits, children and social workers who have worked in foster
    care facilities.\n"
