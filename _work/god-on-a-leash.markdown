    God on a Leash is the story of being held on a leash to the hands of faith, heritage and poverty through an excavation of the relation between humanism and divinity.
    Eleven year old Rohit belongs to a community of ‘Behrupiyas’, traditional impressionists who train their children to act like apes. This fringe community survives under abject poverty, tied firmly to their belief in the power of a Hindu mythological deity 'Hanuman: half
    monkey half human', a symbol of selfless devotion and strength.

    The story follows Rohit, who wishes to become a policeman or doctor but is instead forced into the practice. In the end, he embodies the deity
    and what it stands for - in more ways than one.
    God on a Leash unearths the larger web of restrictive ideologies that twine our minds and bodies, connecting us in kinship to the trapped
    figures populating this film’s artistic landscape.
    I was acquainted with this cultural practice at a very young age and through this film, I attempted to observe and unravel the predicament
    of a child tied on a emblematic leash of poverty, faith and heritage. I was personally moved by how the practice of veneration of a symbol of
    strength unearths an unbreakable cycle of physical, social and material
    oppression.

    India is facing an increasing forms of religious radicalization. It is easy to forget what religion imbues for the disenfranchised. God on a Leash
    strives to scratch the surface of what might appear a mere spectacle.

    social and material oppression. \n\nI was also motivated by the idea of capturing
    a rare insight into the lives of niche performers, pushed to the fringes of the
    society. I experienced aspects of great profundity mixed with sorrow while capturing
    the child get ready and perform on the streets. My attempt was to impart visceral
    qualities of a rustic folk tale to the piece through the camera and sound work.
