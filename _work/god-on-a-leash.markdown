- title: Synopsis
  content: Dalip is a monkey charmer who belongs to a small community of ‘Madaris’,
    an ancestral occupation of training monkeys to act like humans. Eleven year old
    Rohit belongs to a community of ‘Behrupiyas’, traditional impressionist who train
    their kids to act like apes. Both these fringe communities survive under abject
    poverty, tied firmly to their belief of a Hindu mythological deity Hanuman, Half
    monkey-half human’, a symbol of selfless devotion and strength. Both convene to
    perform at Hanuman temple. In a role reversal battle between animal as human and
    human as animal, who would come out triumphant?

- title: Concept
  content: The film draws parallels between the life of a captured monkey family,
    20 year old Dharmendra, his 15 year old mate Hema and their offspring Isha. They
    all travel from place to place with their human master Daleep. These animals dress
    up and perform actions like humans for public amusement. Amidst all the frolic
    lies the true reality of how they are being mistreated and trained. Their teeth
    are taken out, they are starved out and are kept in an pathetic state in a flies
    and mosquito infested area, tied to a rusted iron leash. On the other hand, we
    follow a child from the Behrupiya (impressionist) community who dresses up like
    a monkey and mimics the animal for public entertainment. The impressionist community
    is in a dire state of being, safeguarding a thousand year old artform. The community
    suffers with the lack of education and the coming generation is forced to be in
    the state of poverty due to lack of an alternate skill. Without a proper rehabilitation,
    they would continue to be in the chains of poverty.

- title: Director's Statement
  content: God on a leash is a short documentary that was shot in my hometown of New
    Delhi. I was acquainted to this cultural practice at a very young age and through
    this documentary, I am finally able to unravel the intricacies of this culture.
    We followed a Madari, who sat with his macaques and their o spring near a Hanuman
    temple at North Campus. It seemed the baby’s future in chains was indomitable,
    much like the o springs of the ancestral impressionists community. It created
    a cruel euphemism about our ignorance, the way we choose to live our lives, follow
    our traditions and practice our faith. The film is a window to a highly embellished
    niche world with a contrastingly unembellished human experience.
