intro: Two ancestral artforms survive through the veneration of Hanuman, a hindu deity
  with a monkey face and human body. This is the story of being held on a leash to
  the hands of faith, heritage and poverty that explores the concept of humanism and
  divinity.

- title: Background
  content: "\"Gabroo\" is a punjabi term for a young soul. \nThe Film is a coming
    of age comical story with a heart at its epicenter. It borrows from my own experiences
    of juggling native identity and appeals to the first-generation immigrant experience.
    As Indian origin artists working in the US, our goal is to highlight the distinct
    struggle of a demographic less seen on screen. Through this effort, we wish to
    bring the Sikh-American story and identity to the forefront.\n"
